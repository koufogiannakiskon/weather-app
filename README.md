# Weather App

## Overview

The Weather App is a web application built using React and Material-UI that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city in the world. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, it leverages the Unsplash API to fetch city images as background, providing a visually appealing experience for users.

### Features

Get Weather Information: Users can enter the name of any city in the search box and click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve the current weather details for that location.

Dynamic Backgrounds: The app displays stunning city images fetched from Unsplash as backgrounds, creating a visually engaging user interface.

City Suggestions: As the user types in the city name, the app suggests matching city names based on the Geonames API, enhancing the user experience and helping them find their desired location faster.
